from the ceiling just outside the bedroom, once in the attic you get an eerie feeling as if
you are not supposed to be here.''')
kitchen = Room("Kitchen", '''Once you enter the kitchen, at first glance the kitchen looks
normal. At a closer look you see what looks like animals and knifes litter the counter and
table. Each layed out in such a way\n that makes it look like they are not done with there
work.''')
livingroom = Room("Living Room", '''When you enter the living room you notice a dusty sofa
like it hasn't been used in a while. The entertainment stand is filled with books. Upon
closer inspection of the room, other than the ceiling lights there appears to be no
technology of any kind.''')
bedroom = Room("Bedroom", '''Upon entering the bedroom, you see a worn out bed, with equally
worn out sheets. There is a wooden dresser with a smashed mirror, sitting on the dresser is
a doll, the doll is old, deffinetly not from this time era. The doll almost seems to be
waiting, maybe even watching.''')
basement = Room("Basement" , '''A set of stairs that lead under the hourse. The room is dark,
no light reaches the basements from up on the stairs throught the door. You hear water
dripping, and smell the dampness in the room, the room feels oddly cold for such a warm night
outside with a eeire sense to the basement.''')
bathroom = Room("Bathroom", '''Once inside the bathroom, you are consumed with the sense of
darkness, even with the room being well lit with a few burning candles that seem to glow
brighter than should be possible. The bathroom is fairly standard. There is a toilet and an
old styled tub, it looks to be from the 1800s. There is a counter with a sink and above the
sink is a shattered mirror. On the counter seems to be vials and beakers filled with what
appears to be glowing fluids.''')
